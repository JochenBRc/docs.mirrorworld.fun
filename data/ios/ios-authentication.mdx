# Authentication

Token saved in local by SDK would be out of date. So when a user opens the app, the developer should check his authentication every time. If token is invalidate, we should guild users to login again.
For example, you can follow the logic like this:

```Swift
MWSDK.CheckAuthenticated { onBool in
   print("CheckAuthenticated:\(onBool)")
}
```
