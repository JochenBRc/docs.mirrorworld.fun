# Authentication

Token saved locally by SDK would be out of date. So when a user opens the app, they should check their authentication every time. If the token is invalidated, we should guide users to login again.

For example, you can follow the logic like this:

```Swift
MWSDK.CheckAuthenticated { onBool in
   print("CheckAuthenticated:\(onBool)")
}
```
