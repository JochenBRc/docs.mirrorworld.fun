Welcome to Mirror World! If you are new to the Mirror World SDK, don't worry, in the next tutorials, we will show you how to use and play with our product.

## What is dashboard?
- Dashboard is where you can manage your projects and API keys, as well as get real-time metrics for projects. To start interacting with our SDK, you need to launch your projects on our dashboard platform to get some basic access permission codes (API keys, client_id, etc.). 
## Create an account
- Firstly, please visit https://app.mirrorworld.fun/auth/login and sign up. You will need this account to access all the features we provided. If you have any issues with your account, you can email sdk@mirrorworld.fun or join our discord/ telegram to report to our team directly.

Once you've signed in dashboard, you will be directed to our home page, which contains some resources that help you better understand how to use our SDK as well as find some support during the development process.

> A clear name will let you know which game you are working on and will definitely be helpful when managing multiple games.


## Find your API keys, Client_id and Client_secret
1、To get access to our SDK, you will need to know 3 project codes that we generate for you when you set up your project:
> - API Key: Authorizes a client to access our API. Without it, no requests can be authorized. 
> - Client_id - Used as a publicly sharable project_Id that can be used in the place of the actual id primary key property. This key is also appended to the JWT in v1 login and signup endpoints. This will allow other services to identify which project this user has been authenticated for.
> - Client_secret - A sensitive value that the project owner/developer will use to verify certain claims about their project on Mirror World SSO. For example, if a project authenticates with Mirror World, and hopes to access  another project user's data in their project, they will use this secret to verify the claims they submit via the verification endpoint.

2、After you create your project, you will see it on the projects list (You can find the project list on the Home page or Projects page).  Click the name of your project, you will be directed to the project detail page that contains API keys, Client_id and Client_secret.
