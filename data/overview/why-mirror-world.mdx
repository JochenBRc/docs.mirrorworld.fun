# Why we built the Mirror World Smart SDK?

Traditional Web 3 Development is cumbersome on mobile devices and requires both developers and
users to have prior knowledge of complex concepts like key pairs, wallets, seed phrases, private key
security and transaction signing to perform basic operations on the blockchain.
