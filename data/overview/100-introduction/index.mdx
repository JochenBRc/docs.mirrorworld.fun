# Introduction

The Mirror World Smart SDK is a cross-platform SDK that provides a simple, declarative
API interface for building Mobile and Web dApps in a multi-chain context.

We built Mirror World to accelerate the adoption of decentralized technologies. At present there are a lot of challenges
faced with building decentralized applications:

- **For users**, the _onboarding process is severely complex_ - requiring new user to install various wallet extensions and learn
about private key management before they even interact with the dApp is a taxing effort.
- **For developers**, it is no hidden secret that _building Web 3 applications is also significantly complex_.
The average developer will not only have to have proficiency both at the protocol level for blockchain development, they must also possess
application level proficiency to build a successful dApps to their users. This increases the time to market.

For individuals/teams with limited time and resources, this effort would be better spent improving their core product and iterating
quickly for their users.

Therefore, we built the Mirror World Smart SDK to make it easy for developers to:
- **Onboard new Web3 users with one click.** - No more seed-phrases! Mirror World's Smart Auth provides authentication with methods your users are already familiar with.
- **Fast-track your Web3 development time.** - The Mirror World API provides a simple, yet powerful and declarative interface for interacting with the chain.
- **Target multiple platforms** - The Mirror World Smart SDK is cross-platform. Build for the Web. Build for Mobile. Build with speed.

## Core Features
The core features provided by Mirror World Smart SDK are Smart Auth, Smart Marketplace & the Smart Wallet.

### Smart Authentication
Smart Auth enables free, seamless, one-click authentication - onboarding million of Web3 users with fraction of the cost.
- **Free forever** - Onboarding users is just the first step to building a successful dApp. So we provide this service free of charge.
- **Go mainstream** - Supports mainstream social authentication providers that users are familiar with (Google, Facebook, Twitter, Discord, Apple, e.t.c.)
- **Self-custody wallet support** - Want to use MetaMask or Phantom to authenticate? No problem! You can still authenticate your users with self-custody wallets on Mirror World.

### Smart Wallet
Smart Wallet enables one-click payment integration for developers, solves the issue of geographic coverage
- **Non-custodial MPC Wallet** - When users signup on Mirror World, we generate a non-custodial wallet (MPC-TSS) for them. The user's wallet is the same across dApps.
- **Plug N' Play Wallet UI** - The Mirror World Smart SDK provides a customizable Wallet UI for your users so you can still display the wallet UI to your users.
- **Fiat-to-crypto on ramp in 200+ geographies with instant payments** - Buy crypto from anywhere. No need to do a two-month-long KYB process so users can buy tokens for your dApp. (We got you!)

## Roadmap
The Mirror World team has been working tirelessly to ship all the features this ecosystem needs to be built. Here is our 2022 Roadmap üëáüèΩ

To see a full picture of our roadmap:
- **[Q4 / 2022 Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/mirrorworld-universe/projects/1/views/3)**
- **[Q3 / 2022 Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/mirrorworld-universe/projects/1/views/2)**

## Multi-chain support
We started our Mirror World Smart SDK primary on [Solana](https://solana.com) because of its low fees, high TPS and growing community to
support our games ecosystems. However, we are **currently building to support a multi-chain ecosystem in our SDK, starting with EVM support in Q1/2023**
