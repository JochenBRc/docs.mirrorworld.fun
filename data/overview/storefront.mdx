# Marketplace Storefront Deployment Guide
This guide will enable you to create an NFT Marketplace using the Mirror World Smart SDK.

> The Marketplace on Mirror World is currently available on Solana Mainnet and Devnet.


## Creating your Marketplace
1. On the [developer dashboard](https://app.mirrorworld.fun), under the projects tab, create a Marketplace for your project by completing the prompts.
2. Include the collections you would like to list on your marketplace.

## Creating the Storefront
After creating the Marketplace on the Developer Dashboard, you're ready to create a storefront. A storefront is a user interface that your users will use to buy and sell NFTs on your Marketplace. The storefront serves as the UI for your marketplace core.

### Storefront creation guide
### 1. Clone [storefront template repository](https://github.com/mirrorworld-universe/marketplace-storefront)
```sh
git clone git@github.com:mirrorworld-universe/marketplace-storefront.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```sh
yarn install
```

### 3. Setup storefront `userConfig.json` variables. 

Download your `userConfig.json` from your project's Marketplace on the [developer dashboard](https://app.mirrorworld.fun). It should look something like the example below:
```json
{
  // Array of collection addresses
  "collections": [
    "DUuMbpmH3oiREntViXfGZhrLMbVcYBwGeBa4Wn9X8QfM"
  ],
  // API Key
  "xApiKey": "mw_testAmRKdRbBsBbIAw3CeMqS9GORmcG5BRUCU4D",
  // Marketplace commission fee in percentage
  "serviceFee": 4.25,
  // Marketplace storefront currency
  "currencyOption": "SOL",
  // Storefront name
  "name": "Mirror Jump",
  // Storefront Logo URL
  "logo": "",
  // Storefront Network
  "network": "mainnet"
}
```
