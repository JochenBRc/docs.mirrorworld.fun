# Introduction to Mirror World

The Mirror World Smart SDK is a cross-platform interface that provides simple, declarative
API interfaces for building Mobile and Web Applications into Web 3 Architecture.

## Our Vision
The vision of the Mirror World Smart SDK is to create easy-to-integrate tools to help creators
step out of the walled-garden solutions to building digital economies on decentralized applications and games.

## Our Mission
Mirror World's contribution to this vision is to create top-class composable and easy-to-use APIs and SDKs for building
applications and games on a decentralized web without limits. Our core SDK primarily provides features around Authentication, NFT APIs,
Marketplaces and Storefronts, Tokenization and On-ramp strategies.


### Our Focus on Mobile
One core emphasis that the team at Mirror World has focused on is on Mobile. We believe strongly that the future is mobile.
As builders of games ourselves, we are familiar with the problems within traditional game development, that include on-boarding for Web3,
transaction processing, storefronts, and have created building blocks that help solve these problems elegantly with Web 3. Our work in mobile gaming
as well as the growing community of over 70000+ members represents our commitment to the vision of creating and maintaining these APIs and SDKs.

### Our open-source initiative
We also want to foster an open-source friendly community where builders can contribute to the tools we create and be rewarded
for their significant contributions to the Mirror World development ecosystem.

## Roadmap
The Mirror World team has been working tirelessly to ship all the features this ecosystem needs to be built. Here is our 2022 Roadmap üëáüèΩ

## Cross-chain support
We started our Mirror World Smart SDK primary on [Solana](https://solana.com) because of it's low fees, high TPS and growing community to
support our games ecosystems. However we are keen to support a multi-chain and cross-platform ecosystem in our SDK.
