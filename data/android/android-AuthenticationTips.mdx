# Authentication Tips

## User login with different social accounts.
Every kind of social account login will provide a new wallet for users. These wallets are not same.

## Login invalidation
Token saved in local by SDK would be out of date. So when a user opens the app, the developer should check his authentication every time. If token is invalidate, we should guild users to login again.
For example, you can follow the logic like this:  

```java
MirrorSDKJava.getInstance().IsLoggedIn(new MirrorCallback(){
    @Override
    public void callback(boolean isLoggedIn) {
        if(isLoggedIn){
            //todo: enter content directly
        }else {
            //todo: show a button leading user to login.
        }
    }
});
```
