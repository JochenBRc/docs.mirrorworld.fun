In this tutorial, we shall be covering how to authenticate your users with the
Mirror World SDK. This specific tutorial will be focusing on JavaScript for the
front end.

> We shall be creating more tutorials for back end authentication soon! If you
> are looking for other frameworks, please see the
> [integration guides for **Android, Unity, iOS and Rust**](/integration).

## Getting Started

### Create a Mirror World Project

The first step to building with the Mirror World SDK is to create a project and
get it's **API Key**. Please follow the guide on
[creating your first Mirror World Project](/overview/getting-started).

If you have an API Key, you can skip the step.

### Install dependencies

> [Unity Installation Guide](/integration/unity) for Android and Unity
> respectively

## Building the Application

Let‚Äôs go ahead and build a simple application that integrates the Mirror World
API.

Our client is a Next js application that connects with the Mirror World API to
log users in and displays their user details and wallet addresses.

### Project Setup

Create a Next JS app by running this command in your terminal

```shell
yarn create next-app mirrorworld-js
# or
npx create-next-app@latest mirrorworld-js
```

### Install the Mirror World Smart SDK

Next, let‚Äôs make sure we have¬†the Mirror World Smart SDK¬†installed in our
project. This will enable us to run the following command in your project‚Äôs root
directory, in the terminal:

```shell
yarn add @mirrorworld/web3.js
```

### Implementing Login

Let‚Äôs implement login functionality into our app using the Mirror World Smart
SDK. To use the SDK, we‚Äôll need to create a new instance of the SDK.

Edit your **index.js** file to look like this

üìÅ¬†**pages/index.js**

```tsx
import { MirrorWorld, ClusterEnvironment } from "@mirrorworld/web3.js"
import styles from "../styles/Home.module.css"

export default function Home() {
  const mirrorworld = new MirrorWorld({
    apiKey: "YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY", // Replace this with the API Key for your project
    env: ClusterEnvironment.testnet, // Can be ClusterEnvionment.mainnet for mainnet
  })

  return <div className={styles.container}></div>
}
```

Next, we‚Äôre going to create a function that logs the user in, and a button to
trigger that function.

Update your **index.js** file to look like this

```tsx
import { useState } from "react"
import { MirrorWorld, ClusterEnvironment } from "@mirrorworld/web3.js"
import styles from "../styles/Home.module.css"

const [user, setUser] = useState()

async function login() {
  const { user } = await mirrorworld.login()
  setUser(user)
}

return (
  <div className={styles.container}>
    <main className={styles.main}>
      <button onClick={login}>Login to Mirror World</button>
    </main>
  </div>
)
```

As you can see, we‚Äôve bound the login method to the button. When you click on
the button a popup appears giving you multiple options to login to mirror world.

We also include a user state using the `useState` hook from React so that we can
set the user object and use it in our app as we‚Äôll see shortly.

Let‚Äôs go ahead and display the user information in our app with this piece of
code:

```tsx
return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <main className={styles.main}>
        <button onClick={login}>Login to Mirror World</button>
        {user ? (
          <div className="user-info">
              <ul>
                <li>Username: {user.username} </li>
                <li>Email: {user.email}</li>
                <li>ETH Address: {user.wallet.eth_address}</li>
                <li>SOL Address: {user.wallet.sol_address}</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
        ) : (
          <p>No User available</p>
        )}
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Try to log in again and you should see your user details displayed like this:

## Where to go from here

As you can see, the Mirror World Smart SDK is quite easy to set up and work
with. There are also a lot of other things you can do with the SDK such as swap
tokens and mint NFTs, so don‚Äôt just stop at user authentication.

The documentation is a great place to start learning about all the things you
can do with the SDK. The Mirror World team is constantly trying to provide the
best development experience possible, it‚Äôll be great if you joined the Discord
channel and reported issues encountered while developing on their
[GitHub](https://github.com/mirrorworld-universe). Can‚Äôt wait to see what you
build!
