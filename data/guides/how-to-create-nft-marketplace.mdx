With the growing popularity of NFTs, more people are looking for ways to trade
these digital assets for some money. After minting an NFT or a collection of
NFTs, how do you show them to the world and possibly trade them for their value?
This is why NFT marketplaces exist.

Since NFTs exist on the blockchain, it makes sense to also develop the NFT
marketplace on the blockchain. Solana is great for building marketplaces because
of its speed and cost-effectiveness. Solana can process 50,000 transactions per
second (TPS) at peak load, making it arguably the fastest blockchain in
operation today. It also imposes transaction fees of $0.00025 per transaction,
which is great compared to other traditional blockchain networks and most
preferred for building games and dApps that require high volume transactions.

In this guide, we'll learn how we can create our own marketplace using the
Mirror World Smart SDK.

## What Is An NFT Marketplace?

Just like any other online marketplace for digital assets, NFT marketplaces
allow you to store and sell NFTs. It's that simple. In an NFT marketplace, the
NFTs are usually available for purchase or auction at a set price determined by
the NFT creator. Some popular NFT marketplaces include Hyperspace, MagicEden,
SolSea, OpenSea, etc.

However, the traditional NFT Marketplace will make your users jump back and
forth between different apps, making the whole transaction process longer and
affecting the user experience. To solve this issue, Mirror World provides
In-game NFT store, where users do not need to jump out of the dApp, the whole
trading process can be completed directly in the dApp, which greatly optimizes
the user experience and helps you achieve the growth of trading volume.

## How To Create A Marketplace

To create a marketplace on Solana, you'll need:

- A Solana Wallet
- NFTs or a collection of NFTs

Luckily for us, Mirror World provides all the necessary tools to make this a
quick and easy process. Let's look at all the steps that'll help us create our
own marketplace.

marketplace on the developer dashboard. Check details here.
