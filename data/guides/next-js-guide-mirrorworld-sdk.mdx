The Mirror World SDK is a set of cross-platform tools that provides simple,
declarative interfaces for developers with no blockchain development experience
to seamlessly build Mobile and Web Applications into Web3 Architecture.

It is the key you need to be able to build on Mirror World. With the Mirror
World Smart SDK, you can easily authenticate your users, create secure wallets,
mint NFTs and deploy marketplaces with just a few lines of code.

Mirror World currently has SDK support for Android, iOS (in development), Unity,
Javascript and Rust with support for more frameworks coming soon.

In this tutorial, we‚Äôll be taking a look at how to set up the SDK using
JavaScript.

## Getting Started

### Create an Account

To start using the SDK, you‚Äôll need to <span onClick = {()=> {
window.mixgather.event("developer_dashboard")
window.open("https://app.mirrorworld.fun")}}>[create a developer
account]()</span>. Your account grants you access to all the features needed to
build on mirror world and it can be created within seconds. If you run into any
issues creating an account, Mirror World has active communities on <span onClick
= {()=> { window.mixgather.event("join_telegram")
window.open("https://mirrorworld.fun/telegram")}}>[telegram]()</span> and <span
onClick = {()=> { window.mixgather.event("join_discord")
window.open("https://mirrorworld.fun/discord")}}>[discord]()</span>[]() with
people on the Mirror World team ready to help.

### Create a Project

Once you‚Äôve successfully created and verified your account, you‚Äôll be able to
sign in to your developer dashboard. The dashboard contains helpful resources
that‚Äôll assist you in the future when you start building. Go ahead and click the
‚ÄúCreate Project‚Äù button to start your first project. Enter a clear project name
in the popup and click ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù.

### Project Credentials

Every project is created with three major credentials that‚Äôll be used in
developing Mirror World:

1. API Key: Used to authorize a client to access the Mirror World API.
2. Client ID: Used to publicly identify your project.
3. Client Secret: Sensitive credential that the project owner/developer will use
   to verify certain claims about their project on our Authentication services.

## Building the Application

Let‚Äôs go ahead and build a simple application that integrates the Mirror World
API.

Our client is a Next js application that connects with the Mirror World API to
log users in and displays their user details and wallet addresses.

### Project Setup

Create a Next JS app by running this command in your terminal

```shell
yarn create next-app mirrorworld-js
# or
npx create-next-app@latest mirrorworld-js
```

### Install the Mirror World SDK

Next, let‚Äôs make sure we have¬†the mirror world SDK¬†installed in our project.
This will enable us to

Run the following command in your project‚Äôs root directory, in the terminal:

```shell
yarn add @mirrorworld/web3.js
```

### Implementing Login

Let‚Äôs implement login functionality into our app using the Mirror World SDK. To
use the SDK, we‚Äôll need to create a new instance of the SDK.

Edit your **index.js** file to look like this

üìÅ¬†**pages/index.js**

```tsx
import { MirrorWorld, ClusterEnvironment } from "@mirrorworld/web3.js"
import styles from "../styles/Home.module.css"

export default function Home() {
  const mirrorworld = new MirrorWorld({
    apiKey: "YOUR_SECRET_API_KEY", // Replace this with the API Key for your project
    env: ClusterEnvironment.testnet, // Can be ClusterEnvionment.mainnet for mainnet
  })

  return <div className={styles.container}></div>
}
```

Next, we‚Äôre going to create a function that logs the user in, and a button to
trigger that function.

Update your **index.js** file to look like this

```tsx
import { useState } from "react"
import { MirrorWorld, ClusterEnvironment } from "@mirrorworld/web3.js"
import styles from "../styles/Home.module.css"

const [user, setUser] = useState()

async function login() {
  const { user } = await mirrorworld.login()
  setUser(user)
}

return (
  <div className={styles.container}>
    <main className={styles.main}>
      <button onClick={login}>Login to Mirror World</button>
    </main>
  </div>
)
```

As you can see, we‚Äôve bound the login method to the button. When you click on
the button a popup appears giving you multiple options to login to mirror world.

We also include a user state using the `useState` hook from React so that we can
set the user object and use it in our app as we‚Äôll see shortly.

Let‚Äôs go ahead and display the user information in our app with this piece of
code:

```tsx
return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <main className={styles.main}>
        <button onClick={login}>Login to Mirror World</button>
        {user ? (
          <div className="user-info">
              <ul>
                <li>Username: {user.username} </li>
                <li>Email: {user.email}</li>
                <li>ETH Address: {user.wallet.eth_address}</li>
                <li>SOL Address: {user.wallet.sol_address}</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
        ) : (
          <p>No User available</p>
        )}
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Try to log in again and you should see your user details display like this:

## Where to go from here

As you can see, the MirrorWorld SDK is quite easy to set up and work with. There
are also a lot of other things you can do with the SDK such as swap tokens and
mint NFTs, so don‚Äôt just stop at user authentication.

The documentation is a great place to start learning about all the things you
can do with the SDK. The Mirror World team is constantly trying to provide the
best development experience possible, it‚Äôll be great if you joined the discord
channel and reported issues encountered while developing on their<span onClick =
{()=> { window.mixgather.event("explore_github")
window.open("https://github.com/mirrorworld-universe")}}>[GitHub]()</span> .
Can‚Äôt wait to see what you build!
