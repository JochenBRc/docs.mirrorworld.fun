# Rust Integration Guide

This guide will walk you through the setup process for the Mirror World Smart SDK on Rust.

## Step 1: Create a Developer Account
Create a developer account on the [Developer dashboard](https://app.mirrorworld.fun). Create project and create an API Key. If you already have an API Key, you may skip this step and proceed to the next one.

  ## Step 2 - Install dependencies

  Add the `mirrorworld-sdk-rust` to your `Cargo.toml`. Alternativly you can run
  `cargo add mirrorworld-sdk-rust`.

  ```sh shell.sh
  cargo add mirrorworld-sdk-rust
  ```

  ## Step 3 - Import the SDK in your file
  Import the installed SDK into your file and start building!

  ```rust main.rs
  // Import all modules
  use mirrorworld_sdk_rust::*;

  // Or you may import specific methods
  use mirrorworld_sdk_rust::{
    // ...
    login_with_email,
    // ...
  };
  ```
