# Unity Integration Guide

This guide will walk you through the setup process for the Mirror World Smart SDK on Unity.

## Step 1 - Create a Developer Account
Create a developer account on the [Developer dashboard](https://app.mirrorworld.fun). Create project and create an API Key. If you already have an API Key, you may skip this step and proceed to the next one.

## Step 2 - Import the Mirror World SDK
There are 2 ways to install the Mirror World Unity SDK:

1. One way is to [download the latest release assets](https://github.com/mirrorworld-universe/mirrorworld-sdk-unity/releases) from the official GitHub repository. Import it to your
project `Assets > Import Package > Custom Package` and select the package
you just downloaded.

2. You may also search for the package in the [Unity Assets Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/) with
the keyword "`com.mirror.sdk`" and import it.

## Step 3 - Configuration with adding prefab manually

Explanation of the fields above image:

- **Api Key**: Input your API key from the [developer dashboard](https://app.mirrorworld.fun).
- **Debug Mode**: If you check this, you will be able to see all the console output and error notices
on the console.
- **Environment**: Choose the environment you want to use.
- **Debug Email and Password**: In the pre-release beta, you can only login to the SDK using this function.

  ## Step 4 - Initialize the Mirror World SDK

  In your project, you may now initialize the Mirror World SDK as a `GameObject`.

  ```csharp SomeActivity.cs
  GameObject mirrorObj = new GameObject("MirrorSDK", typeof(MirrorSDK));
  string apiKey = "your api key";
  bool debugMode = true;
  Environment environment = Environment.StagingDevnet;

  MirrorSDK.InitSDK(apiKey, mirrorObj, debugMode, environment);
  ```

  ## Step 5 - Authenticate the user

  For the best user experience, guide the user to authenticate when they open your app.

  You may want to know whether this user needs to log in. You can call the `IsLoggedIn` method to determine this.
  A boolean result is returned in the callback.

  ```csharp AuthenticationCheck.cs
  MirrorSDK.IsLoggedIn((isLoggedIn) => {
    Debug.Log("isLoggedIn:" + isLoggedIn);
  });
  ```

  ---
  If you want the user to login, you can use the following code:

  ```csharp StartAuthentication.cs
  MirrorSDK.StartLogin();
  ```
