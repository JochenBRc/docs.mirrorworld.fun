# ShowCase

Here are some showcases to help you quickly understand what our SDK can offer
and what the experience is like.

## Mirrors Jump

Mirror Jump is a mini-game that fully utilizes the Mirror World Smart SDK and is
dedicated to helping more developers understand the features of the Smart SDK.

In this game we have integrated Authentication, NFT APIs, Marketplaces and
Storefronts, Tokenization and On-ramp strategies, all in just 30 minutes.
