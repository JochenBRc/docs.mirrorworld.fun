## Authentication

## User login with different social accounts

Every kind of social account login will provide a new wallet for users. These wallets are not same.

## Login invalidation

Token saved in local by SDK would be out of date. So when a user opens the app, the developer should check his authentication every time. If token is invalidate, we should guild users to login again.
For example, you can follow the logic like this:  

```cs
MirrorSDK.IsLoggedIn((isLoggedIn)=>{
    if(isLoggedIn){
        //TODO: Show content directely
    }else{
        //TODO: Show login page
    }
});
```

**There are several points that need to be mentioned:**

1. The APIKey must be owned to the debug email;

2. The debug email must be the same as the one used in developer dashboard.
