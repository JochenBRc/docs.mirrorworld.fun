# Authentication

## User login with different social accounts.
Every kind of social account login will provide a new wallet for users. These wallets are not the same.

## Login invalidation
Token saved locally by SDK would be out of date. So when a user opens the app, the developer should check his authentication every time. If the token is invalidated, we should guide users to login again.
For example, you can follow the logic like this:  

```cs
MirrorSDK.IsLoggedIn((isLoggedIn)=>{
    if(isLoggedIn){
        //TODO: Show content directely
    }else{
        //TODO: Show login page
    }
});
```
