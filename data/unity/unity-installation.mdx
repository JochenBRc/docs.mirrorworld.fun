Explanation of beyond image:

- **Api Key**: Input your API key from the developer dashboard on
  https://app.mirrorworld.fun
- **Debug Mode**: If checking this, you could see all the flow and error notices
  on the console.
- **Environment**: Choose the environment you want to use.
- **Debug Email and Password**: In the pre-release beta, you can only login SDK
  with this function. Input your email and password at
  https://docs.mirrorworld.fun.

### Configuration dynamic

We can init Mirror World SDK with the following code:

```cs
GameObject mirrorObj = new GameObject("MirrorSDK", typeof(MirrorSDK));
string apiKey = "your api key";
bool debugMode = true;
Environment environment = Environment.StagingDevnet;

MirrorSDK.InitSDK(apiKey, mirrorObj, debugMode, environment);
```

2. Guide user to login When the user opens your app, you may want to know
   whether this user needs to log in, you can call the `IsLoggedIn` method. The
   boolean result is returned in the callback.

```cs
MirrorSDK.IsLoggedIn((isLoggedIn) => {
    Debug.Log("isLoggedIn:" + isLoggedIn);
});
```

If you want the user to login, you can use the following code:

```cs
MirrorSDK.StartLogin();
```
