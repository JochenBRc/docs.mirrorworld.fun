# Authentication
The Javascript SDK provides two methods for user authentication: `loginWithEmail` and `login`. Both of these
authenticate the user, and return a `refreshToken` that can be used to silently authenticate a user without
requiring them to login manually.

This refresh token is safe to store in your application client. If the `autoLoginCredentials` are provided to the
SDK, then the user is automatically logged in by the SDK.

## Silent Authentication
Here is an example of how to silently authenticate your user when your application has loaded.

```ts
import { MirrorWorld, ClusterEnvironment } from "@mirrorworld/web3.js"


const refreshToken = "USER_REFRESH_TOKEN"

const mirrorworld = new MirrorWorld({
  apiKey: "SUPER_SECRET_API_KEY",
  env: ClusterEnvironment.mainnet,
  clientId: "foo",
  autoLoginCredentials: refreshToken
})

mirrorworld.on('auth:refreshToken', async (refreshToken) => {
  await saveTheUsersNewRefreshToken(refreshToken)
  await mirrorworld.value.fetchUser()

  console.log(mirrorworld.user) // Logs user object.
})
```
