# How to authenticate with self-custody wallets

Mirror World's Smart SDK supports authentication with self-custodial wallets
This allows you to authenticate users on Mirror World using your EVM or Solana
wallets.

## Use cases

This is useful where you may want to authenticate with a wallet like Metamask
instead of email address.

If you're building on mobile and you have a native self-custody wallet like
MetaMask or Phantom, for example, you can log your users in by signing a message
that authenticates them on our API.

## Keypair Authentication

You can also execute the message signing without a wallet UI. If you can
construct a key-pair for your wallet, you can also sign the authentication
message.
